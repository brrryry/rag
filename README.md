This project was made to test the capabilities of a secure RAG architecture.

## How to use!
- clone this repository!
- (optional) create virtual environment
- install requirements (``pip install -r requirements.txt``)
- run through the jupyter notebook to train the model (``train_model.ipynb``)
- run program to try the model out (``python test_model.py``)!

Feel free to change the model (in the notebook) and add more data if you want. We could use more!

## Notes:
- This model trains on articles from 2015. This data source will eventually be provided.
- The README has to be documented better. I will do this soon.
